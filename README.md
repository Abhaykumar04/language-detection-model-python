A different language is a different vision of life.

• If your model is dependent on one language then, other languages in your textual data should be considered as noise.
Your model will not stop classifying the non-English text. So, you have to detect the non-English text and remove it from trained data and prediction data.

• This process comes under the data cleaning part. Inconsistency in your data will result in a decrease in the accuracy of the model. Sometimes, multiple languages present in text data could be one of the reasons your model behaves strangely.

# Application of language detection
➡️ Find out bias in text data based on the languages.

➡️ You can classify the article based on the different languages.

➡️ Language is generally associated with the region. This method helps you to classify the article based on languages.

➡️ You can use this method in the language translation model.

➡️ You can use it in data cleaning and data manipulation processes.
